- AI suggestions is free during this early stage, but may change later!
- **OAuth Login Required**: You'll need a Bluesky handle to sign in

## OAuth Authentication

This app uses AtProto OAuth for authentication. Simply enter your Bluesky handle (e.g., `username.bsky.social`) and you'll be redirected to authenticate with your provider.

### Supported Environments

- **Localhost**: `http://127.0.0.1:3000` (uses loopback client configuration)
- **Preview**: `https://bluelist-three.vercel.app` (Vercel preview deployments)
- **Production**: `https://listy.blue` (production domain)

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

If you want to run this locally, you'll need:

- An OpenAI developer account
- Your own OpenAI API key (set in the environment variables)
- Optional: Set exempt DIDs in the environment variables to bypass daily limits

### Environment Variables

The app uses different environment files for different deployments:

#### `.env.local` (Development)

```bash
NUXT_ATP_SERVICE=https://bsky.social
NUXT_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
NUXT_EXEMPT_DIDS=

# OAuth Configuration for localhost
NUXT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=http://127.0.0.1:3000/client-metadata.json
NUXT_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:3000/oauth-callback
NUXT_APP_ORIGIN=http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

#### `.env.preview` (Vercel Preview)

```bash
NUXT_ATP_SERVICE=https://bsky.social
NUXT_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
NUXT_EXEMPT_DIDS=your_exempt_dids

# OAuth Configuration for preview environment
NUXT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=https://bluelist-three.vercel.app/client-metadata.json
NUXT_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=https://bluelist-three.vercel.app/oauth-callback
NUXT_APP_ORIGIN=https://bluelist-three.vercel.app
```

#### `.env.production` (Production)

```bash
NUXT_ATP_SERVICE=https://bsky.social
NUXT_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
NUXT_EXEMPT_DIDS=your_exempt_dids

# OAuth Configuration for production environment
NUXT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=https://listy.blue/client-metadata.json
NUXT_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=https://listy.blue/oauth-callback
NUXT_APP_ORIGIN=https://listy.blue
```

### Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Development Server

Start the development server on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The app will automatically use the localhost OAuth configuration for development.

### OAuth Client Metadata

The app includes client metadata files in the `public/` directory:

- `public/client-metadata.json` - Contains OAuth client configuration
- The metadata is automatically served with proper CORS headers
- For localhost, the app uses the built-in loopback client configuration

### Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
yarn build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
yarn preview
```

## Technical Details

Built with:

- **Nuxt 3** - Vue.js framework
- **@atproto/oauth-client-browser** - AtProto OAuth client for browsers
- **@atproto/api** - AtProto API integration

### OAuth Implementation

- Follows AtProto OAuth specification for "Desktop App" clients
- Uses PKCE, DPoP, and PAR for security
- Handles token refresh automatically
- Supports multiple environments with environment-specific configurations
